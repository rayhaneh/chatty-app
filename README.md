Chatty App
=====================

A client-side SPA (single-page app) uses React, a popular front-end library created and used heavily by Facebook as well as modern tools for Node including Webpack and Babel for multi-user real-time updates. No persistent database is involved in this app; the focus is on the client-side experience.
